# The Odin Project

## == About The Odin Project ==

The Odin Project is a free, open-source platform that helped me transition from a beginner to a full-stack web developer. Through hands-on projects and a collaborative community, I gained practical experience in building real-world applications. Iâ€™ve worked with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to develop a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development.
