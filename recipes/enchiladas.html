    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Enchiladas are a traditional Mexican dish made with corn tortillas that are rolled around a filling, which can
        include a variety of ingredients like shredded meat,
        cheese, beans, potatoes, or vegetables. The rolled tortillas are then smothered in a flavorful sauce—usually
        made from red or green chilies—and baked. They are often
        topped with garnishes like sour cream, cheese, lettuce, or onions. Enchiladas can be served with rice, beans, or
        guacamole as sides. The sauce and filling can vary
        depending on regional and personal preferences.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Filling</li>
        <p>Choose your filling—shredded chicken, beef, or beans. Sauté with onions, garlic, and your favorite
            seasonings.</p>
        <li>Make the Sauce</li>
        <p>In a pan, heat oil and sauté garlic and onion. Add chili powder (for red sauce) or green chilies (for green
            sauce),
            then add tomato paste or diced tomatoes, broth, and seasonings. Simmer until thickened.</p>
        <li>Soften the Tortillas</li>
        <p>Lightly fry the corn tortillas in oil for a few seconds to make them pliable, or warm them in the microwave.
        </p>
        <li>Assemble the Enchiladas</li>
        <p>Spread a little sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Fill each tortilla with the prepared filling, roll them
            up, and place them in the dish.</p>
        <li>Top and Bake</li>
        <p>Pour the remaining sauce over the rolled tortillas, sprinkle with cheese, and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25
            minutes, until bubbly and golden.</p>
        <li>Garnish and Serve</li>
        <p>Top with sour cream, cilantro, lime wedges, or your favorite toppings. Serve with rice, beans, or guacamole.
